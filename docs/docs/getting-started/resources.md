### Getting Help

- For questions on Numba and other parts, the best place to go to is [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- If you have general questions, start a new [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/polakowo/vectorbt/discussions)
- If you found what appears to be a bug, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/polakowo/vectorbt/issues)

!!! hint
    Active development and support has moved to [__vectorbt.pro__](https://vectorbt.pro/), which means
    that I will less likely provide an assistance in GitHub Discussions and Issues. 

    Sponsor me on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/polakowo) and get access to our private 
    Discord server where you can get an instant support from our vibrant community. In addition, 
    vectorbt PRO is (much) easier to use and provides a range of exclusive examples and articles!
